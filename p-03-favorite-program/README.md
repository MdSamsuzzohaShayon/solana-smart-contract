## **Solana Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)**  
A **Program Derived Address (PDA)** in Solana is a special type of address **owned by a program** rather than a private key. Unlike regular Solana accounts, PDAs:  
✅ **Cannot be signed** by a private key  
✅ **Are deterministically derived** using a **program ID** and **seeds**  
✅ **Are used for program-controlled accounts**, such as escrow accounts, staking vaults, and user metadata storage  

## **Building a "Favorites" Program**  
We will build a Solana program using **[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/)** and **Anchor**.  

### **Setup Guide**  
1. **Create a new project**  
2. **Set a project name**  
3. **Select the Anchor framework**  
4. **Modify `lib.rs`**  
   - Delete all existing content  
   - Write a new program from scratch
